### Description

This module takes inspiration from Gundancer's [Roof Occlusion Vision And Fade](https://github.com/Gundancer/foundryvtt-roof-occlusion-vision-fade) which is currently unmaintained and incompatible with Foundry versions above 10.

It enhances the vanilla occlusion behaviour for tiles set to "vision," introducing an option to make a tile fade when an owned and selected token moves underneath.
