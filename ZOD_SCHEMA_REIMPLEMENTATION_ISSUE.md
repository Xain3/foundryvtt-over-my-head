# Reimplement Zod Schema Validation

## Issue Summary
Reimplement Zod schema validation for constants parsing that was temporarily removed during development to resolve blocking issues.

## Background
Zod schema validation was temporarily removed from the codebase on 26 May 2025 to resolve development blockers. This functionality should be restored once development stabilizes.

## What Was Removed
- `src/maps/stringToZodType.js` - Type mapping utility for converting strings to Zod types
- `src/maps/stringToZodType.unit.test.js` - Tests for the type mapping utility
- `buildContextSchema()` method in `ConstantsParser` class
- `buildContextSchema` parameter from `parseConstants()` method
- Zod schema building logic from constants parsing

## Implementation Requirements

### Files to Restore/Modify:
1. **`src/maps/stringToZodType.js`**
   - Function to map string type names to Zod schema types
   - Support for basic types: string, number, boolean, object, array
   - Error handling for unknown types

2. **`src/constants/helpers/constantsParser.js`**
   - Add `buildContextSchema()` static method
   - Restore `buildContextSchema` parameter to `parseConstants()` method
   - Add Zod schema building logic back to the parsing flow

3. **Test Files**
   - Restore `src/maps/stringToZodType.unit.test.js`
   - Add Zod-related tests back to `constantsParser.unit.test.js`
   - Update integration test in `tests/integration/constants.int.test.js` to expect Zod schema

### Dependencies:
- `zod` package (already installed)

## Reference Materials
- **Backup Location**: `/backup/zod-schema-removal/`
- **Backup Archive**: `zod-schema-files-backup.zip`
- **Documentation**: `ZOD_SCHEMA_REMOVAL_DOCUMENTATION.md`

All original implementation files are backed up and can be used as reference for the reimplementation.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Zod schema validation is restored for constants parsing
- [ ] All original functionality is preserved
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Integration test validates Zod schema presence
- [ ] Error handling is maintained
- [ ] JSDoc documentation is complete
- [ ] Type safety is maintained

## Priority
**Medium** - This is a quality-of-life improvement that adds runtime validation but doesn't block core functionality.

## Labels
- enhancement
- schema-validation
- zod
- constants
