# styles Directory

## Purpose

This directory contains the CSS stylesheets for the "Over My Head" Foundry VTT module. These styles define the visual appearance of UI elements, overlays, and other graphical components rendered by the module within Foundry VTT.

## Structure

- **`foundryvtt-over-my-head.css`**: The main stylesheet containing all CSS rules for the module's interface elements, such as text overlays, positioning, and visual effects.

## Usage

The styles are typically bundled or referenced in the module's manifest (`module.json`) to ensure they are loaded when the module is active in Foundry VTT. Changes to these files should be tested in a Foundry environment to verify visual consistency.
