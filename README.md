![Roof Occlusion Vision And Fade](README-img/TileConfig.gif)

In the gif below, the roof is a red tile. When occlusion mode is set to vision, the roof tile still covers up the rooms on the map that the token cannot see. When you select the also fade checkbox, the roof tile will disappear showing the room underneath.
