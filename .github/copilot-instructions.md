### Javascript Settings ###
- Use ES6 syntax for all code.
- Use `const` and `let` instead of `var`.
- Use arrow functions instead of function expressions.
- Use template literals instead of string concatenation.
- Use destructuring assignment for objects and arrays.
- Use async/await for asynchronous code instead of callbacks or promises.
- Use `import` and `export` for module imports and exports.
- Use `class` syntax for creating classes.
- Prefer 2-space indentation over tabs.
- Prepend the file with a comment block that includes the file name, date, and author in the format:
  ```javascript
  /**
  * @file filename.js
  * @description This file contains a function to get the context of a given element.
  * @path the relative path to the file
  * @date 2024-05-15
  * @author GitHub Copilot
  */
  ```
- Use JSDoc comments for function documentation.
- JSDoc for inherited classes should include the parent class name and indicate the inherited methods and properties that are used or overridden.
