# Test Suite Fixes Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to fix npm test failures related to aliasing issues and incomplete mocks in the FoundryVTT Over My Head project.

## What Changed

### ContextHelpers Unit Tests

- **File**: `src/contexts/helpers/contextHelpers.unit.test.mjs`
- **Change**: Replaced the hand-rolled Validator mock with an import of the real module (using `importActual`), so static helpers like `Validator.isPlainObject` are available during container construction.
- **Why**: The stubbed mock lacked `isPlainObject`, causing a constructor failure in `ContextContainer`.

### PathUtils Integration Test Scaffolding

- **File**: `tests/integration/contextHelpers.int.test.mjs`
- **Change**: Mock now subclasses/defers to the real PathUtils to preserve true behavior while allowing spies.
- **Why**: Over-mocking PathUtils broke deep path resolution and nested-path checks used across context helper flows.

### Performance Suite Validator Coverage

- **File**: `tests/performance/context.performance.test.mjs`
- **Change**: Switched to a partial mock that imports the real `#utils/static/validator.mjs` and overrides only the date validator; removed empty alias stubs.
- **Why**: The suite needs `Validator.isPlainObject` and friends for realistic performance runs; stubs caused runtime errors and skewed results.

### SettingsHandler Unit Test Alias Fixes

- **File**: `src/handlers/settingsHandler.unit.test.mjs`
- **Change**: Adjusted to import `#helpers/settingsRetriever.mjs` via configured alias.
- **Why**: Old/non-aliased imports caused module resolution failures.

### ErrorFormatter Test Config Shape

- **Files**:
  - `src/helpers/errorFormatter.unit.test.mjs`
  - `src/utils/static/errorFormatter.unit.test.mjs`
- **Change**: Expanded mocked `#config` to include `constants.errors` (separator/pattern) and `manifest.shortName` where needed.
- **Why**: Tests assert on formatted output; they require the same shapes used in production code.

### ContextHelpers Unit Test Config Completeness

- **File**: `src/contexts/helpers/contextHelpers.unit.test.mjs`
- **Change**: Enriched `#config` mock with:
  - `context.helpers.mergeStrategies` (including `UPDATE_SOURCE_TO_TARGET`, etc.)
  - `context.helpers.comparisonResults`
  - `context.helpers.errorMessages.unsupportedObjectType`
- **Why**: Downstream helpers reference these constants; missing values caused undefined references in unit tests.

### PlaceableChecker API Restoration

- **File**: `src/handlers/placeableHelpers/placeableChecker.mjs`
- **Change**: Restored `isOwned`, `isOwnedAndControlled`, and `isOwnedAndSelected` with logging.
- **Why**: Tests and dependent helpers expected these methods; their absence broke placeable checks.

### Validator Usage Consistency

- **Multiple Tests**
- **Change**: Where the suite previously fully mocked Validator, updated patterns to import the real module and only override targeted pieces.
- **Why**: Prevents accidental removal of required static helpers across various code paths.

## Why These Changes Were Needed

- **Alias Normalization**: Several tests used outdated direct paths; moving to `#` aliases matches the project's build/runtime config and avoids resolution drift.
- **Realistic Mocks**: Over-mocking foundational utilities (Validator, PathUtils) led to missing methods and non-representative behavior, causing both crashes and misleading results.
- **API Completeness**: Restoring expected public methods in `placeableChecker.mjs` and ensuring config constants exist stabilizes dependent tests and docs.

## Outcomes

- **Tests**: PASS. Full suite ran cleanly.
  - Files: 99 passed
  - Tests: 2609 passed
- **Performance Suite**: Executes without TypeErrors; timings logged as expected.
- **Integration Suites**: For context helpers/settings/overMyHead all green with realistic behavior.

### Quality Gates

- **Build**: Not run in this pass; no build-time changes introduced.
- **Lint/Typecheck**: Not run in this pass.
- **Tests**: PASS (as above).

## Notes and Follow-ups

- Centralize test fixtures for `#config` constants to avoid repetition and future drift (e.g., a shared mock factory).
- Prefer partial mocks with `importActual` for foundational utilities; only stub what a test needs.
- Consider pruning or excluding `old-handlers/` from coverage if kept only for historical reference to avoid noise.
- If desired, add a tiny test helper to standardize alias-aware mock patterns (Validator/PathUtils).

## How to Run

- **Quick Verification**:

  ```zsh
  npm test
  ```

- **Focused Re-run for the Previously Failing Unit**:
  ```zsh
  npm test -- src/contexts/helpers/contextHelpers.unit.test.mjs
  ```

## Completion Summary

Adjusted the Validator mocking strategy in `contextHelpers.unit.test.mjs` to use the real module (fixing the `isPlainObject` error) and, across the session, aligned alias imports, restored expected APIs, and improved mock completeness. Validated the result by running the full test suite, which now passes end-to-end.
